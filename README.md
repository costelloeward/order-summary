## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

Decided to make the cancel and change buttons more prominent to avoid the design looking like a dark pattern. 
Did not include underlining on change, as it is a button rather than a hyperlink. Room for debate on that one!
Left off the shadow from the payment button to make the design cleaner.
Including focus as well as hover for active states, need to read more about this.
